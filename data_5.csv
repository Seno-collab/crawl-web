Words and Their Stories: Expressions with the Word 'Cold' (VOA Special English 2008-03-19),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_03/audio/mp3/se-ws-cold.mp3, Cold: She Felt the Cold Hard Reality of LifeTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Cold weather has a great effect on how our minds and our bodies work. Maybe that is why there are so many expressions that use the word cold.For centuries, the body's blood has been linked closely with the emotions. People who show no human emotions or feelings, for example, are said to be cold-blooded.  Cold-blooded people act in cruel ways. They may do brutal things to others, and not by accident.For example, a newspaper says the police are searching for a cold-blooded killer.  The killer murdered someone, not in self-defense, or because he was reacting to anger or fear.  He seemed to kill for no reason, and with no emotion, as if taking someone's life meant nothing.Cold can affect other parts of the body.  The feet, for example.  Heavy socks can warm your feet, if your feet are really cold.  But there is an expression -- to get cold feet -- that has nothing to do with cold or your feet.The expression means being afraid to do something you had decided to do. For example, you agree to be president of an organization.  But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned.  All the work of the organization will be your responsibility.  You are likely to get cold feet about being president when you understand the situation.Cold can also affect your shoulder.You give someone the cold shoulder when you refuse to speak to them. You treat them in a distant, cold way.  The expression probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face-to-face.  You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you.  Or, to someone who has lied about you to others.A cold fish is not a fish.  It is a person.  But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth.  A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone.Someone who is a cold fish could be cold-hearted.  A cold-hearted person is someone who has no sympathy.  Several popular songs in recent years were about cold-hearted men or cold-hearted women who, without feeling, broke the hearts of their lovers.Out in the cold is an expression often heard.  It means not getting something that everybody else got.  A person might say that everybody but him got a pay raise, that he was left out in the cold.  And it is not a pleasant place to be.This VOA Special English program, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES, was written by  Marilyn Rice Christiano.  Maurice Joyce was the narrator.  I'm Shirley Griffith.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions with the Word 'Hot' (VOA Special English 2008-03-03),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_03/audio/mp3/se-ws-hot.mp3, Hot: He Was a Hotheaded Hot Shot!TEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Every language has its own special words and expressions.  And a story can be told about each of them.Hot is a simple, easily-understood word.  So are most of the expressions made with the word hot.  But not always, as we shall see.The words hot potato, for example, give you no  idea at all to the meaning of the expression, hot potato. The potato is a popular vegetable in the United States. Many people like baked potatoes, cooked in an oven or fire.  Imagine trying to carry a hot, baked potato in your hand.  It would be difficult, even painful, to do so.Now we are getting close to the meaning of hot potato. Some publicly-disputed issues are highly emotional.  The issues must be  treated carefully, or  they  will be difficult and painful  if an elected official has to deal with them. As difficult and painful as holding a hot potato.One such hot potato is taxes.Calling  for higher taxes can mean defeat for a politician.  And yet, if taxes are not raised, some very popular government programs could be cut.  And that also can make a politician very unpopular.  So the questions must be dealt with carefully...the same way you would handle any other hot potato.Another expression is not so hot.  If you ask someone how she feels, she may answer: ""not so hot.""   What she means is she does not feel well.Not so hot also is a way of saying that you do not really like something.  You may tell a friend that the new play you saw last night is not so hot.  That means you did not consider it a success.A hot shot is a person -- often a young person -- who thinks he can do anything.  At least he wants to try.  He is very  sure he can succeed.  But often he fails. The expression was born in the military forces.  A hot shot was a soldier who fired without aiming carefully. Hot is a word that is often used to talk about anger.A person who becomes angry easily is called a hothead.  An angry person's neck often becomes red.  We say he is hot under the collar.  You could say that your friend is no hothead. But he got hot under the collar when someone took his radio.In nineteen sixty-three, hot line appeared as a new expression.The hot line was a direct communications link between the leaders of the  Soviet Union and the United States. The hot line had an important purpose: to prevent accidental war between the two competitors during the period known as the Cold War.  The American president and the Soviet leader were able  to  communicate directly and immediately on the hot line.  This helped  prevent  any conflict during an international crisis.You have been listening to the VOA Special English program, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions with the Word 'Easy' (VOA Special English 2009-06-05),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_06/audio/mp3/se-ws-as-easy-as-falling-off-a-log-07-june-09_0.mp3, Easy As Falling Off a Log: Not Much Effort Involved!TEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Every people has its own way of saying things, its own special expressions. Some of these expressions are easy to understand. The words create a picture in your mind.
""As easy as falling off a log"" is one such expression. It describes a job that does not take much effort.
If you ever tried to walk on a fallen tree log, you understand what the expression means. It is easier to fall off the log than to stay on it.
The expression is often used today. For example, you might hear a student say to her friend that her spelling test was ""as easy as falling off a log.""
There are several other expressions that mean the same thing. And their meaning is as easy to understand as ""falling off a log."" One is, ""easy as pie"". Nothing is easier than eating a piece of sweet, juicy pie. Unless it is a ""piece of cake.""
""Piece of cake"" is another expression that means something is extremely easy to do. A friend might tell you that his new job was a ""piece of cake.""
Another expression is ""as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.""
It is hard to imagine why anyone would want to shoot fish in a barrel. But, clearly, fish in a barrel would be much easier to shoot than fish in a stream. In fact, it would be as easy as ""falling off a log"".
Sometimes, things that come to us easily, also leave us just as easily. In fact, there is an expression – ""easy come, easy go"" – that recognizes this. You may win a lot of money in a lottery, then spend it all in a few days. Easy come, easy go.
When life itself is easy, when you have no cares or problems, you are on ""Easy Street."" Everyone wants to live on that imaginary street.
Another ""easy"" expression is to ""go easy on a person"". It means to treat a person kindly or gently, especially in a situation where you might be expected to be angry with him. A wife might urge her husband to ""go easy on"" their son, because the boy did not mean to wreck the car.
If it is necessary to borrow some money to fix the car, you should look for a friend who is an ""easy touch"". An ""easy touch"" or a ""soft touch"" is someone who is kind and helpful. He would easily agree to lend you the money.
And one last expression, one that means do not worry or work too hard. Try to keep away from difficult situations. ""Take it easy"" until we meet again.

"Words and Their Stories: ""Bird"" Expressions (VOA Special English 2008-06-30)",http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_06/audio/mp3/se-ws-bird-words.mp3, Bird Words: Someone Who Eats Like a Bird Eats Very LittleTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Today we explain some expressions about birds.  For example, if something is for the birds, it is worthless or not very interesting.  Someone who eats like a bird eats very little.  And a birds-eye view is a general look at an area from above.
Did you know that if you tell a young person about the birds and the bees you are explaining about sex and birth?  Have you ever observed that birds of a feather flock together?  In other words, people who are similar become friends or do things together.  Here is some good advice: a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  This means you should not risk losing something you have by trying to get more of something you do not have.
Sometimes I can do two things by performing only one action.  This is called killing two birds with one stone.  But I would never really kill any birds. I love all kinds of animals. This is a real feather in my cap.  It is something to be proud of.
Most of the people I work with are early birds. They believe that the early bird catches the worm.  They think that a person who gets up early in the morning for work has the best chance of success.  Everyone in my office works hard, but some people have had their wings clipped.  Their jobs have been limited.  This is because the office is organized by pecking order.  People with more years and experience are given more responsibility.
Some bird expressions are about crows, chickens and ducks. For example, when I am driving, I always travel as the crow flies.  I go the most direct way.  Anyone who eats crow has to admit a mistake or defeat.
Now let's talk about my sister. She is not very young.  She is no spring chicken. She will work any job for chicken feed -- a small amount of money.  She is easily frightened. For example, she is too chicken-livered to walk down a dark street alone at night.  Often she will chicken out – she will not go out alone at night.
My sister was an ugly duckling.  She looked strange when she was a child, but she grew up to be a beautiful woman.  Sometimes she thinks too much about having something in the future before she really has it.  She counts her chickens before they are hatched.  Sometimes her chickens come home to roost.  That means her actions or words cause trouble for her.  However, my sister does not worry about what people say about her.  Criticism falls off her like water off a duck's back.
Politicians are sometimes considered lame ducks after losing an election. They have little time left in office and not much power. Congress holds a lame duck session after an election.  Important laws are not passed during this period.

Words and Their Stories: 'Cat' Expressions (VOA Special English 2009-09-25),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_09/audio/mp3/se-ws-cat-expressions-27-sept-09_0.mp3, When the Cat's AwayTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Cats are the most popular pets among Americans. So it is not surprising that there are many expressions about cats. Some cats like to catch small birds, like canaries. If someone looks very proud or satisfied with himself, we say he looks like the cat that ate the canary.
Sometimes, a cat likes to play with a small animal it catches.
So if you play cat and mouse with someone,you change between different kinds of behavior when dealing with another person. For example, a child might offer something sweet to her little brother and then take it away when he reaches for it.
A cat will often catch a small animal and present it to its owner. The saying that looks like something the cat dragged in describes something in bad condition.
Two old and funny expressions describe something that is the best or finest. Americans might say that something is the cat's meow and the cat's pajamas.
Children might call a child who is easily frightened a fraidy cat or a scaredy cat. A copycat is someone who acts just like someone else or copies another person's work. A fat cat is a person with a lot of money.
You may have known that cats spend most of their time sleeping. Sometimes people sleep for a short time during the day.  This is called a cat nap.
If you tell about something that was supposed to be a secret, we say you let the cat out of the bag. If you are not able to speak or answer a question someone might ask if the cat has got your tongue.
Have you ever watched children in a classroom when their teacher leaves for a few minutes? When the cat's away, the mice will play means people sometimes misbehave when there is no supervision.
You may have heard this expression: curiosity killed the cat.This means being too concerned about things that are not your business might cause problems.
If your home is very small, you might say there is not enough room to swing a cat.  But you probably should not try this at home!
If you ever had cats as pets, you know it is difficult to train them or to get them to do something.  Cats are not like sheep or cows that can be moved in a group.  So we say a difficult or impossible job is like herding cats.
We leave you with a song from the musical play, ""Cats.""

Words and Their Stories: 'Dog' Expressions (VOA Special English 2008-12-06),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_12/audio/mp3/ws dog talk 120708_0.mp3, Dog Talk: Every Dog Has His DayTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Americans use many expressions with the word dog. People in the United States love their dogs and treat them well. They take their dogs for walks, let them play outside and give them good food and medical care. However, dogs without owners to care for them lead a different kind of life. The expression, to lead a dog's life, describes a person who has an unhappy existence.
Some people say we live in a dog-eat-dog world. That means many people are competing for the same things, like good jobs. They say that to be successful, a person has to work like a dog. This means they have to work very, very hard. Such hard work can make people dog-tired. And, the situation would be even worse if they became sick as a dog.
Still, people say every dog has its day. This means that every person enjoys a successful period during his or her life. To be successful, people often have to learn new skills. Yet, some people say that you can never teach an old dog new tricks. They believe that older people do not like to learn new things and will not change the way they do things.
Some people are compared to dogs in bad ways. People who are unkind or uncaring can be described as meaner than a junkyard dog. Junkyard dogs live in places where people throw away things they do not want. Mean dogs are often used to guard this property. They bark or attack people who try to enter the property. However, sometimes a person who appears to be mean and threatening is really not so bad. We say his bark is worse than his bite.
A junkyard is not a fun place for a dog. Many dogs in the United States sleep in safe little houses near their owners' home. These doghouses provide shelter. Yet they can be cold and lonely in the winter.
Husbands and wives use this doghouse term when they are angry at each other. For example, a woman might get angry at her husband for coming home late or forgetting their wedding anniversary. She might tell him that he is in the doghouse. She may not treat him nicely until he apologizes. However, the husband may decide that it is best to leave things alone and not create more problems. He might decide to let sleeping dogs lie.
Dog expressions also are used to describe the weather. The dog days of summer are the hottest days of the year. A rainstorm may cool the weather. But we do not want it to rain too hard. We do not want it to rain cats and dogs.

Words and Their Stories: 'Fish' Expressions (VOA Special English 2008-06-30),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_06/audio/mp3/se-ws-fish-expressions.mp3, Fish Expressions: This All Sounds Very FishyTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Americans use many expressions about fish and fishing.nbsp; For example, if something sounds fishy, it may not be true.  Sometimes I feel like a fish out of water when I go to a party and everyone but me is doing the latest dance.  When I ask my friend if she likes my new dress, I would like her to say something nice.  In other words, I am fishing for a compliment.  You might tell someone to fish or cut bait if he repeatedly attempts to do something he is unable to do.
Sometimes a lawyer will ask a witness many questions in an effort to discover the facts of a court case.  This is called going on a fishing expedition.  
Some expressions involve different kinds of fish.  Information that is used to draw attention away from the real facts of a situation is called a red herring.  If you want to express a feeling of surprise, you might cry ""holy mackerel!"" although we do not know why a mackerel is holy.
Once I went to a county fair and tried my luck with a game of chance.  It was so easy; it was like shooting fish in a barrel.  Then I went on the fastest, highest and most frightening ride: the roller coaster.  At the end of the ride, I did not feel so well.  A friend said I looked green around the gills.
I grew up in a small town where everybody knew about my life.  There were times when I thought I was living in a fishbowl.  So I moved to Washington, where things were different.
 Now I take the train to work every day during rush hour when many other people travel to their jobs.  Sometimes the train is so crowded that we are packed in like sardines.  Sardines are tiny fish that lie close to each other in cans.
One man who works in my office is a cold fish.  He is unfriendly and does not like to join us at office parties.  Another man in my office likes to enjoy alcoholic drinks at parties.  In fact, you might say he drinks like a fish.  We need to help him stop drinking.
Last week, my sister's car broke down as we were driving to a friend's marriage ceremony.  ""This is a fine kettle of fish,"" I said. ""Now we will be late.""
My sister attends a small college where she is one of the smartest students.  She always wants to be a big fish in a small pond.  Recently, my sister broke up with her boyfriend.  I told her not to worry, she will find another one because there are plenty of other fish in the sea.

"Words and Their Stories: ""Horse"" Expressions (VOA Special English 2009-07-12)",http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_07/audio/mp3/se-ws-horse-expressions-12-july-09_0.mp3, Hold Your Horses!TEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Today, we tell about ""horse"" expressions.  In the past, many people depended on horses for transportation, farming and other kinds of work.  A lot of people still like to ride horses.  And, horse racing is also popular.  So it is not surprising that Americans still use expressions about the animals.
Long ago, people who were rich or important rode horses that were very tall.  Today, if a girl acts like she is better than everyone else, you might say she should get off her high horse.
Yesterday my children wanted me to take them to the playground.  But I had to finish my work, so I told them to hold your horses.  Wait until I finish what I am doing.  My two boys like to compete against each other and play in a violent way.  I always tell them to stop horsing around or someone could get hurt.
We live in a small town.  It does not have any exciting activities to offer visitors.  My children call it at a one-horse town.
Last night, I got a telephone call while I was watching my favorite television show.  I decided not to answer it because wild horses could not drag me away from the television.  There was nothing that could stop me from doing what I wanted to do.
Sometimes you get information straight from the horse's mouth.  It comes directly from the person who knows most about the subject and is the best source.  Let us say your teacher tells you there is going to be a test tomorrow.  You could say you got the information straight from the horse's mouth.  However, you would not want to call your teacher a horse!
You may have heard this expression: You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink.  That means you can give someone advice but you cannot force him to do something he does not want to do.
Sometimes a person fights a battle that has been decided or keeps arguing a question that has been settled.  We say this is like beating a dead horse.
In politics, a dark-horse candidate is someone who is not well known to the public.  Sometimes, a dark horse unexpectedly wins an election.
Another piece of advice is, do not change horses in midstream.  You would not want to get off one horse and on to another in the middle of a river.  Or make major changes in an activity that has already begun.  In the past, this expression was used as an argument to re-elect a president, especially during a time when the country was at war.

Words and Their Stories: 'Insect' Expressions (VOA Special English 2009-06-26),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_06/audio/mp3/se-ws-bug-expressions-28jun09_0.mp3, Insect ExpressionsTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.There are many American expressions about insects -- like bees, for example. Bees are known as very hard workers. They always appear to be busy, moving around their homes, or hives. So you might say you were as busy as a bee if you spent your weekend cleaning your house.
In fact, you might say your house was a beehive of activity if your whole family was helping you clean. You also might say you made a beeline for something if you went there right away. When we go to see a movie, my friend always makes a beeline for the place where they sell popcorn.
Here is an expression about bees that is not used much any more, but we like it anyway. We think it was first used in the nineteen twenties. If something was the best of its kind, you might say it was the bee's knees. Now, we admit that we do not know how this expression developed. In fact, we do not even know if bees have knees!
If your friend cannot stop talking about something because she thinks it is important, you might say she has a bee in her bonnet.  If someone asks you a personal question, you might say ""that is none of your beeswax."" This means none of your business.
Speaking of personal questions, there is an expression people sometimes use when their children ask, ""where do babies come from?"" Parents who discuss sex and reproduction say this is talking about the birds and the bees.
Hornets are bee-like insects that sometimes attack people. If you are really angry, you might say you are mad as a hornet. And if you stir up a hornet's nest, you create trouble or problems.
Butterflies are beautiful insects, but you would not want to have butterflies in your stomach. That means to be nervous about having to do something, like speaking in front of a crowd. You would also not want to have ants in your pants. That is, to be restless and unable to sit still.
Here are some expressions about plain old bugs, another word for insects. If a friend keeps asking you to do something you do not want to do, you might ask him to leave you alone or ""stop bugging me."" A friend also might tell you again and again to do something. If so, you might say he put a bug in your ear.
If you were reading a book in your warm bed on a cold winter's day, you might say you were snug as a bug in a rug. And if you wish someone good night, you might say, ""sleep tight -- don't let the bed bugs bite.""

In fact, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution says that monkeys and humans share a common ancestor.Songwriter William Gilbert, in the musical ""Princess Ida"", wrote:""Darwinian man, though well-behaved, at best is only a monkey shaved.""His words -- sung to Sir Arthur Sullivan's music -- make listeners smile. Well, monkeys make us smile, too, because they are creatures full of playful tricks.This is why many monkey expressions are about tricky people or playful acts. One of these expressions is monkeyshines, meaning tricks or foolish acts.The meaning is clear if you have ever watched a group of monkeys playfully chasing each other: pulling tails, stealing food, doing tricks. So, when a teacher says to a group of students: ""Stop those monkeyshines right now!"" you know that the boys and girls are playing, instead of studying.You might hear that same teacher warn a student not to monkey around with a valuable piece of equipment. You monkey around with something when you do not know what you are doing. You are touching or playing with something you should leave alone.Also, you can monkey around when you feel like doing something, but have no firm idea of what to do. For example, you tell your friend you are going to spend the day monkeying around with your car. You do not have any job or goal in mind. It is just a way to pass the time.Monkey business usually means secret, maybe illegal, activities. A news report may say there is monkey business involved in building the new airport, with some officials getting secret payments from builders.You may make a monkey out of someone when you make that person look foolish. Some people make a monkey out of themselves by acting foolish or silly.If one monkey has fun, imagine how much fun a barrel of monkeys can have. If your friend says he had more fun than a barrel of monkeys at your party, you know that he had a really good time.Monkey suits are common names for clothes or uniforms soldiers wear.In earlier years in many American cities, you would find men playing musical hand organs on the street.  Dancing to the music would be the man's small monkey dressed in a tight-fitting, colorful jacket similar to a military uniform. So, people began to call a military uniform a monkey suit.

Words and Their Stories: 'Pig' and 'Hog' Expressions (VOA Special English 2008-10-17),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_10/audio/mp3/voa-se-ws-pig-expr-18oct08.mp3.mp3, Who Put Lipstick on That Pig?TEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Americans often use expressions about animals.
In 2008, the main candidates for president each used this expression: ""You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig.""  This means that it is a waste of time to change something from ugly or unpleasant-looking to beautiful.
There are other expressions about improving a pig's appearance, like this one: ""A hog in a silk waistcoat is still a hog.""  Hogs are similar to pigs, only bigger.  Americans use many other expressions about pigs, hogs and female hogs called sows.  Like this one: ""You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.""  This means you cannot create something valuable from something that has no value.
In a pig's eye is another unusual expression.  It means something that is not so, or will never happen.  Then there is the expression casting pearls before swine.  That means wasting something valuable on someone who will not be thankful or care about it.
However, at least one kind of pig can be useful in saving money.  It is called a piggy bank.  You can buy a small container shaped like a pig.  It has a hole where a child can put money into it.
Hogs are very large animals.  If you say you ate high on the hog during a holiday, it means you ate very good or costly food.  If you went whole hog on your trip, it means you did everything possible to have fun.  But you should never go hog-wild at any time because that means behaving badly.
Hogs take up a lot of space but people should not take up more than their share.  If one of your children is taking up too much space sitting in front of the television, other children might say: ""Do not hog the couch.""  And a road hog is a driver who uses more than his share of the road.  Such a driver increases dangers for other drivers.
Pig terms are also used in American politics.  Farmers mark their pigs' ears to identify them.  In politics, earmarks are money set aside for projects in a congressman's home state or locality.  And politicians might say there is a lot of pork in a budget proposal, meaning wasteful spending.
In many areas, pigs provide ham, bacon and other pork products to eat.  All Americans want to be able to bring home the bacon.  That means to earn enough money to provide the necessities of life.  Experts say this term was first used in the nineteen twenties.  But it is believed to come from the much older game of catching a greased pig.  This was a popular event at country fairs in which the winner was awarded the pig.

"Words and Their Stories: ""Wildcat"" Expressions (VOA Special English 2007-10-15)",http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2007_10/audio/mp3/se-ws-wildcat.mp3, Wildcat: Is It a Fast Car or False Money?TEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Today, we tell about the word wildcat.Humans have always depended on animals. From the beginning of human history, wild animals provided food, clothing and sometimes medicine.We may not depend as much on wild animals now. But we hear about them every day. Americans use the names of animals in many ways.Many companies use animals to make us want to buy their goods. Automobile companies, for example, love to show fast horses when they are trying to sell their cars. They also name their cars for other fast powerful animals.Automobile manufacturers and gasoline companies especially like to use big cats to sell their products. They like lions, tigers and wildcats.When Americans say wildcat, they usually mean a lynx, an ocelot or a bobcat. All these cats attack quickly and fiercely. So wildcats represent something fast and fierce.What better way is there to sell a car than to say it is as fast as a wildcat. Or, what better way is there to sell gasoline than to say that using it is like putting a tiger in your tank.An early American use of the word wildcat was quite different. It was used to describe members of Congress who declared war on Britain in eighteen twelve.  A magazine of that year said the wildcat congressmen went home. It said they were unable to face the responsibility of having involved their country in an unnecessary war.Wildcat also has been used as a name for money. It was used this way in the eighteen hundreds. At that time, some states permitted banks to make their own money. One bank in the state of Michigan offered paper money with a picture of a wildcat on it.Some banks, however, did not have enough gold to support all the paper money they offered. So the money had little or no value. It was called a wildcat bill or a wildcat bank note. The banks who offered this money were called wildcat banks.A newspaper of the time said those were the days of wildcat money. It said a man might be rich in the morning and poor by night.Wildcat was used in another way in the eighteen hundreds. It was used for an oil well or gold mine that had almost no oil or gold in it. Dishonest developers would buy such property. Then they would sell it and leave town with the money. The buyers were left with worthless holes in the ground. Today, wildcat oil wells are in areas that are not known to have oil.Yet another kind of wildcat is the wildcat strike. That is a strike called without official approval by a union. During World War Two, an American publication accused wildcat strikers of slowing government production.This VOA Special English program, Words and Their Stories, was written by Jeri Watson.

Today, wildcat oil wells are in areas that are not known to have oil.Yet another kind of wildcat is the wildcat strike. That is a strike called without official approval by a union.

Automobile manufacturers and gasoline companies especially like to use big cats to sell their products. They like lions, tigers and wildcats.When Americans say wildcat, they usually mean a lynx, an ocelot or a bobcat. All these cats attack quickly and fiercely. So wildcats represent something fast and fierce.What better way is there to sell a car than to say it is as fast as a wildcat. Or, what better way is there to sell gasoline than to say that using it is like putting a tiger in your tank.An early American use of the word wildcat was quite different. It was used to describe members of Congress who declared war on Britain in eighteen twelve.  A magazine of that year said the wildcat congressmen went home. It said they were unable to face the responsibility of having involved their country in an unnecessary war.Wildcat also has been used as a name for money. It was used this way in the eighteen hundreds. At that time, some states permitted banks to make their own money. One bank in the state of Michigan offered paper money with a picture of a wildcat on it.Some banks, however, did not have enough gold to support all the paper money they offered. So the money had little or no value. It was called a wildcat bill or a wildcat bank note. The banks who offered this money were called wildcat banks.A newspaper of the time said those were the days of wildcat money. It said a man might be rich in the morning and poor by night.Wildcat was used in another way in the eighteen hundreds. It was used for an oil well or gold mine that had almost no oil or gold in it.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions with the Word 'Eyes' (VOA Special English 2009-09-02),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_09/audio/mp3/se-ws-all-about-eyes-06-sept-09_0.mp3, All About EyesTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Today's program is all about eyes.  When it comes to relationships, people's eyes can be a window into their hearts.  This means that their eyes can tell a lot about how they feel. We will tell a story about a man and woman who are teachers at the same school.  The woman is interested in the man.  She uses many methods to catch his eye, or get him to notice her.  Once he sets eyes on her, or sees her, she might try to get him interested in her by acting playful.  In other words, she might try to make eyes at him or give him the eye.
Let us suppose that this man gets hit between the eyes.  In other words, the woman has a strong affect on him.  He wants to spend time with her to get to know her better.  He asks her out on a date.
She is so happy that she may walk around for days with stars in her eyes. She is extremely happy because this man is the apple of her eye, a very special person. She might tell him that he is the only person she wants, or ""I only have eyes for you.""
On their date, the couple might eat a meal together at a restaurant.  If the man is really hungry, his eyes might be bigger than his stomach.  He might order more food than he can eat.  When his food arrives at the table, his eyes might pop out.  He might be very surprised by the amount of food provided.  He might not even believe his own eyes. If fact, all eyes would be watching him if he ate all the food.  This might even cause raised eyebrows.  People might look at the man with disapproval.
During their dinner, the couple might discuss many things.  They might discover that they see eye to eye, or agree on many issues.  They share the same beliefs and opinions.  For example, they might agree that every crime or injury should be punished.  That is, they firmly believe in the idea of an eye for an eye.  They might also agree that it is wrong to pull the wool over a person's eyes. This means to try to trick a person by making him believe something that is false.  But the man and woman do not believe in the evil eye, that a person can harm you by looking at you.
The next day, at  their school, the woman asks the man to keep an eye on, or watch the young students in her class while she is out of the classroom. This might be hard to do when the teacher is writing on a board at the front of the classroom. To do so, a teacher would need to have eyes in the back of his head.  In other words, he would know what the children are doing even when he is not watching them.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions with the Word 'Face' (VOA Special English 2007-03-12),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2007_03/audio/mp3/se-ws-face.mp3, Face: Time to Face the MusicTEXT,"Now, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES, a VOA Special English program about American expressions.I'm Rich Kleinfeldt with expressions that include the word face.
The first is face the music. It means to accept the results of what you have done.
Here is an example from a Reuters news report: Britain's highest court had ruled that former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was legally arrested.  Opponents of General Pinochet welcomed the news. One of them said, ""We have waited for years for this man to face the music.""
No one is sure how the expression began. One story is that it came from a military ceremony held when a soldier was forced out of an army.
The buttons were cut from the soldier's clothing. He was put on a horse, facing the back of the horse and led away.  As he left, he faced the music of a military band and the soldiers he had served with.
Another story says the expression began in the theater. New actors, shaking with fright, were told that the only cure was to go out and face the music. The music was played by the orchestra seated in front of the stage.
A similar expression is face up to. It means to accept something that is difficult or painful. For example, a man must face up to the fact that he lied about a business deal and will lose his job.  Or, a child must learn to face up to her responsibilities and complete her schoolwork.
Meeting someone face-to-face can be exciting, especially if the other person is famous.  It is an expression one might use after visiting the White House and meeting the president face-to-face. Or a teacher might ask for a face-to-face meeting with the parents of a student in trouble.  It means to talk to someone in person, not by telephone.
Another expression is as plain as the nose on your face.  It means that something is as clear as it can possibly be.
Shakespeare used the words almost five hundred years ago for a joke in his play Two Gentlemen of Verona.  Valentine secretly loves Lady Sylvia. His servant jokes that Valentine's love for her is as hard to see as the nose on a man's face.  Of course, a man's nose cannot be hidden.
A more recent use of the expression appeared in a report in Newsday magazine.  It was about a dispute between the United States and Europe over agriculture. The United States had criticized Europeans for protecting their soybean farmers. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in return criticized the United States for its huge budget deficits. The report said the OECD seemed to be saying, ""For God's sake, it is plain as the nose on your face that you must raise taxes.""

Words and Their Stories: 'Expressions with the Word 'Hair' (VOA Special English 2009-05-02),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_05/audio/mp3/se-ws-hair-03-may-09_0.mp3, 'Hair' – More Than a Rock MusicalTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.A listener named Rita wants to learn about expressions with the word ""hair.""  So we will tell a story.
Yesterday when I woke up, I looked in a mirror.  I looked very neat and organized.  Not a hair was out of place.  But today when I woke up, I knew I was going to have a bad hair day.  My hair was standing up in all the wrong places.  I thought I would be unhappy all day and things would not go well.  I work at home so I just hoped that my computer would work right and not have a bad hair day also.
I was very tired because I did not sleep well last night.  I made the mistake of watching a horror movie on television.  The movie really made my hair stand on end.  It was about a house possessed by evil spirits.  The thought of having to live alone in a house like that was so frightening it was enough to curl your hair.  I will say it another way: watching that movie was a hair-raising experience.
I prepared a meal for my children but they were behaving badly.  I turned on the television so they would be quiet.  I did not want them to be difficult or to get in my hair while I was working on the computer.
My children were making so much noise that I could not work.  I was getting angry.  In fact, I was ready to pull my hair out.  I told them to please be quiet or I would punish them.  But they knew I would not harm a hair on their heads.
I decided to make myself some strong coffee so I could work better.  But my drink was so strong that it could put hair on your chest.
Finally, I got back to work.  I was writing a proposal for a project.  I knew that I was very close to finishing the proposal.  Success was very close – within a hair's breadth.  My supervisor called me to discuss the project.  She wanted to argue about very small differences and unimportant details.  But I told her not to split hairs.
Later, I got a telephone call from a friend whom I had not seen in a long time.  In fact, I had not seen hide nor hair of him in months.  So I was glad to know that he was all right.
I worked all day and finished my project.  So I decided to celebrate, have some fun and let my hair down.  I played some old recordings, and my children and I danced around the room.  The recordings are from my favorite musical, a show called ""Hair.""  It takes place during the nineteen sixties when many young people wore their hair very long.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions with the Word 'Hand' (VOA Special English 2008-04-07),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_04/audio/mp3/se-ws-hand.mp3, Hands: She is Making Money Hand-Over-FistTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.The hand has been a symbol through the ages and in many cultures.There are hundreds of expressions and combinations of words using hand in the English language.  Let us examine some of the expressions that use hand. We will get a hand in this way. To get a hand in is to begin a job, to begin to know something about it.  When we learn the job completely, it will be easy for us.  We will be able to do it hands down.If we do the job well, we may end up with the upper hand.  And that means to be in control, or to have gained complete understanding of a situation.On the other hand, if the situation gets out of hand, then it is out of control.  We must act quickly to regain the upper hand over these expressions.But, wait. We still do not have the upper hand in this business.We must consider another way of expressing praise, to hand it to someone.  For example: I must hand it to you for understanding what we have discussed this far.You can also lend a hand to someone, but without really giving up your hand.  You lend a hand when you help someone. You offer them a helping hand. If someone is kind enough to lend us a hand, then we surely do not want to bite the hand that feeds us.  We do not want to repay his kindness by treating him badly.Now, with that out of the way, we have a free hand to continue examining other hand expressions. To have a free hand in a situation is good.  It means you are free to act without getting permission from someone else.If we continue moving along, we will make progress hand over fist, or very rapidly. This expression began in the early seventeen hundreds.  It reportedly comes from a sailing expression hand over hand, the way of quickly raising or lowering a sail.Maybe you can find a friend who wants to take a hand in our project.  It would have to be someone who is interested in these expressions.Your friend may want to work hand in glove with us. That is good, because that means he wants to work as closely with us as a glove covers the hand.  Of course there is a danger that he may look at our project and decide to take it in hand.  That means he wants to take it over.If that happens, we may throw up our hands because the situation seems hopeless. In fact, we may decide that it is time for us to end this project, to wash our hands of hand expressions.This VOA Special English program, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES,  was written by Marilyn Rice Christiano.

We still do not have the upper hand in this business.We must consider another way of expressing praise, to hand it to someone.  For example: I must hand it to you for understanding what we have discussed this far.You can also lend a hand to someone, but without really giving up your hand.  You lend a hand when you help someone. You offer them a helping hand. If someone is kind enough to lend us a hand, then we surely do not want to bite the hand that feeds us.  We do not want to repay his kindness by treating him badly.Now, with that out of the way, we have a free hand to continue examining other hand expressions. To have a free hand in a situation is good.  It means you are free to act without getting permission from someone else.If we continue moving along, we will make progress hand over fist, or very rapidly. This expression began in the early seventeen hundreds.  It reportedly comes from a sailing expression hand over hand, the way of quickly raising or lowering a sail.Maybe you can find a friend who wants to take a hand in our project.  It would have to be someone who is interested in these expressions.Your friend may want to work hand in glove with us. That is good, because that means he wants to work as closely with us as a glove covers the hand.  Of course there is a danger that he may look at our project and decide to take it in hand.  That means he wants to take it over.If that happens, we may throw up our hands because the situation seems hopeless. In fact, we may decide that it is time for us to end this project, to wash our hands of hand expressions.This VOA Special English program, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES,  was written by Marilyn Rice Christiano.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions with the Word 'Heart' - 1 (VOA Special English 2009-02-14),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_02/audio/mp3/ws heart 021509_0.mp3, Have a HeartTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.  I'm Rich Kleinfeldt with some expressions using the word heart.People believed for a long time that the heart was the center of a person's emotions.  That is why the word heart is used in so many expressions about emotional situations.
One such expression is to ""lose your heart"" to someone.  When that happens, you have fallen in love.  But if the person who ""won your heart"" does not love you, then you are sure to have a ""broken heart.""  In your pain and sadness, you may decide that the person you loved is ""hard-hearted,"" and in fact, has a ""heart of stone.""
You may decide to ""pour out your heart"" to a friend.  Telling someone about your personal problems can often make you feel better.
If your friend does not seem to understand how painful your broken heart is, you may ask her to ""have a heart.""  You are asking your friend to show some sympathy for your situation.  Your friend ""has her heart in the right place"" if she says she is sorry, and shows great concern for how you feel.
Your friend may, however, warn you ""not to wear your heart on your sleeve.""  In other words, do not let everyone see how lovesick you are.  When your heart is on your sleeve you are showing your deepest emotions.
If your friend says, ""my heart bleeds for you,"" she means the opposite.  She is a cold-hearted person who does not really care about your situation.
In the ever-popular motion picture, The Wizard of Oz, the Tin Man seeks a heart.  He wanted to feel the emotion of love, and was seeking help from the powerful Wizard of Oz to find a heart.
The cowardly lion, in the same movie, did have a heart.  But he lacked courage and wanted to ask the Wizard of Oz to give him some.  You could say that the cowardly lion was ""chicken-hearted.""  That is another way of describing someone who is not very brave.  A chicken is not noted for its bravery.  Thus, someone who is chicken-hearted does not have much courage.
When you are frightened or concerned, your ""heart is in your mouth.""  You might say, for example, that your heart was in your mouth when you asked a bank to lend you some money to pay for a new house.
If that bank says no to you, do not ""lose heart.""  Be ""strong-hearted.""  Sit down with the banker and have a ""heart to heart"" talk.  Be open and honest about your situation.  The bank may ""have a change of heart.""  It may agree to lend you the money.  Then you could stop worrying and ""put your heart at rest.""

Today's expressions include a very important word – heart. 
We will try to get to the heart of the matter to better understand the most important things about WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.  So take heart.  Have no fear about learning new expressions.  Besides, popular English words can be fun.  There is no need for a heavy heart.  Such feelings of sadness would only break my heart, or make me feel unhappy and hopeless.
Now, let us suppose you and I were speaking freely about something private.  We would be having a heart to heart discussion.  I might speak from the bottom of my heart, or say things honestly and truthfully.  I might even open up my heart to you and tell a secret.  I would speak with all my heart, or with great feeling.
When a person shares her feelings freely and openly like this, you might say she wears her heart on her sleeve, or on her clothing.  Her emotions are not protected.
If we had an honest discussion, both of us would know that the other person's heart is in the right place.  For example, I would know that you are a kind-hearted and well-meaning person.  And, if you are a very good person, I would even say that you have a heart of gold.  However, you might have a change of heart based on what I tell you.  Our discussion might cause you to change the way you feel about something.
But, let us suppose you get angry over what I tell you. Or worse, you feel no sympathy or understanding for me or my situation.  If this happens, I might think that you have a heart of stone.  And, if you say something to make me frightened or worried, my heart might stand still or skip a beat.
Yet, even though you may be angry, I would know that at heart, you are a kind person.  In reality, you do care.  And any argument between us would not cause me to lose heart or feel a sense of loss.
My heart goes out to anyone who loses a friend over an argument.  It really is a sad situation, and I feel sympathy for the people involved.
I promise that what I have told you today is true – cross my heart.
I really wanted to play some music at the end of this feature.  In fact, I had my heart set on it. So here it is, ""Don't Go Breaking my Heart"" by Elton John.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions with the Word 'Mouth' (VOA Special English 2008-11-22),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_11/audio/mp3/ws mouth expressions 112308_0.mp3, Mouth Expressions: The Experience Left a Bad Taste in My MouthTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.People use their mouths for many things. They eat, talk, shout and sing.  They smile and they kiss.  In the English language, there are many expressions using the word mouth. But some of them are not so nice.
For example, if you say bad things about a person, the person might protest and say ""Do not bad mouth me.""
Sometimes, people say something to a friend or family member that they later regret because hurts that person's feelings.  Or they tell the person something they were not supposed to tell.
The speaker might say: ""I really put my foot in my mouth this time.""  If this should happen, the speaker might feel down in the mouth.  In other words, he might feel sad for saying the wrong thing.
Another situation is when someone falsely claims another person said something.  The other person might protest: ""I did not say that.  Do not put words in my mouth.""
Information is often spread through word of mouth.  This is general communication between people, like friends talking to each other.  ""How did you hear about that new movie?"" someone might ask. ""Oh, by word of mouth.""  A more official way of getting information is through a company or government mouthpiece.  This is an official spokesperson.  Government-run media could also be called a mouthpiece.
Sometimes when one person is speaking, he says the same thing that his friend was going to say. When this happens, the friend might say: ""You took the words right out of my mouth!""  Sometimes a person has a bad or unpleasant experience with another person.  He might say that experience ""left a bad taste in my mouth.""  Or the person might have had a very frightening experience, like being chased by an angry dog.  He might say: ""I had my heart in my mouth.""
Some people have lots of money because they were born into a very rich family.  There is an expression for this, too. You might say such a person, ""was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.""
This rich person is the opposite of a person who lives from hand to mouth.  This person is very poor and only has enough money for the most important things in life, like food.
Parents might sometimes withhold sweet food from a child as a form of punishment for saying bad things. For example, if a child says things she should not say to her parents, she might be described as a mouthy child.  The parents might even tell the child to stop mouthing off.
But enough of all this talk.  I have been running my mouth long enough.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions That Use Body Parts (VOA Special English 2008-05-28),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_05/audio/mp3/se-ws-back.mp3," Back, Shoulders and Chest: A Pat on the Back for a Job Well DoneTEXT","Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.There are many American expressions that use parts of the body.  These include the eyes, ears, nose, mouth and even the heart. Today we will tell you some expressions that use other body parts – the back, shoulders and chest.
When I am facing a lot of pressure at work, my back and neck will start to hurt.  Sometimes, this tension is the result of too much work.  I have too many things to do because my supervisor is on my back all the time.  In other words, my employer is always telling me to do things.
Sometimes, I want to tell my employer to get off my back!   I want her to stop criticizing me and making too many demands on my time.  I can not say this, however.  I would never turn my back on her and refuse to help when there is a need.  If I did refuse to help, my supervisor might say bad things about me behind my back.  She might criticize me when I am not present.  This would surely be a stab in the back.  It is never kind to unfairly harm or say bad things about other people.
Sometimes, when I am very productive in my job, my employer gives me a pat on the back.  She praises my work.  She might even say ""I will scratch your back if you will scratch mine.""  This means she will do something for me, if I do something helpful for her in exchange.  Such an offer usually comes straight from the shoulder.  My supervisor has a very direct, open and honest way of speaking.
I know that my employer carries a lot on her shoulders.  She is responsible for many things at the office.  And because she is so important, she sometimes gets to rub shoulders with the top officials.  She gets to spend time with some very important people.
I believe the top official values my supervisor.  He never gives her the cold shoulder.  He is never unfriendly to her.  He always treats her like she is an important part of the organization.
I also value my supervisor.  In fact, I think she is very effective in her job.  Of course, I could yell my opinion at the top of my lungs, or as loudly as I possibly could.  It might even feel good to get my emotions off my chest.  It is always helpful to tell people how you feel so that your emotions do not trouble you.  
But it is not necessary for me to praise my supervisor.  Most of my co-workers feel the exact same way about her.  So, I think I will just save my breath. I will keep silent because talking or repeating myself will not do any good.

Words and Their Stories: Health Expressions (VOA Special English 2008-05-19),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_05/audio/mp3/se-ws-medical-terms.mp3, Medical Terms: A Clean Bill of Health From the DoctorTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Many professions have their own words and expressions.  This is true for the medical profession.  Doctors use many technical terms that most people do not understand. But there are also expressions we use every day to tell about a person's health.  Let me explain.
Last month, I was not feeling well.  I was under the weather.  I thought I had caught a cold.  I had a runny nose, itchy eyes, a sore throat and a cough.  I felt tired and run down.  I was in poor condition because I had not been getting enough rest.
My body hurt all over.  I also had severe head pains -- a real splitting headache.  And I was running a fever.  My body temperature was higher than normal.
At one point, I blacked out.  That's right, I was out cold.  I lost consciousness and my friend had to bring me around.  He used cold water on my face to restore my consciousness.
I grew concerned that I might take a turn for the worse.  I did not want to become sicker because then surely I would be at death's door.
My friend took me to the doctor.  I told the doctor I thought I had come down with a cold. When the doctor saw me, she immediately wanted to run some tests.  She said that medical tests would help her discover why I was sick.  The doctor also asked when I had my last physical.  I do not get yearly check-ups.  But I probably should get a medical exam by a doctor every year.
Then the nurse drew my blood. She used a needle to take a small amount of blood from my arm.  She sent it to a laboratory for tests.  The nurse also took my temperature.   She used a thermometer to measure my body temperature.
The doctor told me I had influenza, or the flu.  But she told me I would recover soon.  She said I was over the worst of the disease. She told me to rest at home and to stay away from other people because the flu can spread.  It is contagious.
Thankfully, I did not have to go under the knife.  I did not need an operation.  Instead, I did just what the doctor ordered.  I went home and did exactly what was needed to become healthy again.  Soon, I was on the mend.  I was pulling through and recovering from my sickness.
Now, I am back on my feet.  I am physically healthy again.  Even better, the doctor has given me a clean bill of health.  She says that I am one-hundred percent cured.  I am back to normal and I feel great.  In fact, I feel on top of the world.  My friends say I now look like the picture of health.

Red is a hot color. Americans often use it to express heat. They may say they are red hot about something unfair. When they are red hot they are very angry about something. The small hot tasting peppers found in many Mexican foods are called red hots for their color and their fiery taste. Fast loud music is popular with many people. They may say the music is red hot, especially the kind called Dixieland jazz.
Pink is a lighter kind of red. People sometimes say they are in the pink when they are in good health. The expression was first used in America at the beginning of the twentieth century.  It probably comes from the fact that many babies are born with a nice pink color that shows that they are in good health.
Blue is a cool color. The traditional blues music in the United States is the opposite of red hot music. Blues is slow, sad and soulful.  Duke Ellington and his orchestra recorded a famous song – Mood Indigo – about the deep blue color, indigo. In the words of the song: ""You ain't been blue till you've had that Mood Indigo.""  Someone who is blue is very sad.
The color green is natural for trees and grass. But it is an unnatural color for humans. A person who has a sick feeling stomach may say she feels a little green.  A passenger on a boat who is feeling very sick from high waves may look very green.
Sometimes a person may be upset because he does not have something as nice as a friend has, like a fast new car. That person may say he is green with envy. Some people are green with envy because a friend has more dollars or greenbacks. Dollars are called greenbacks because that is the color of the back side of the paper money.
The color black is used often in expressions. People describe a day in which everything goes wrong as a black day. The date of a major tragedy is remembered as a black day.  A blacklist is illegal now.  But at one time, some businesses refused to employ people who were on a blacklist for belonging to unpopular organizations.
In some cases, colors describe a situation. A brown out is an expression for a reduction in electric power.  Brown outs happen when there is too much demand for electricity.  The electric system is unable to offer all the power needed in an area. Black outs were common during World War Two. Officials would order all lights in a city turned off to make it difficult for enemy planes to find a target in the dark of night.

Words and Their Stories: Green Expressions (VOA Special English 2008-08-06),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_08/audio/mp3/se-ws-green.mp3, Green: More Than Just a ColorTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Green is an important color in nature. It is the color of grass and the leaves on trees. It is also the color of most growing plants.
Sometimes, the word green means young, fresh and growing. Sometimes, it describes something that is not yet ripe or finished.
For example, a greenhorn is someone who has no experience, who is new to a situation.  In the fifteenth century, a greenhorn was a young cow or ox whose horns had not yet developed.  A century or so later, a greenhorn was a soldier who had not yet had any experience in battle. By the eighteenth century, a greenhorn had the meaning it has today - a person who is new in a job.
About one hundred years ago, greenhorn was a popular expression in the American west.  Old-timers used it to describe a man who had just arrived from one of the big cities back east. The greenhorn lacked the skills he would need to live in the hard, rough country.
Someone who has the ability to grow plants well is said to have a green thumb. The expression comes from the early nineteen hundreds.
A person with a green thumb seems to have a magic touch that makes plants grow quickly and well. You might say that the woman next door has a green thumb if her garden continues to grow long after your plants have died.
The Green Revolution is the name given  some years ago to the development of new kinds of rice and other grains. The new plants produced much larger crops.  The Green Revolution was the result of hard work by agricultural scientists who had  green thumbs.
Green is also the color used to describe the powerful emotion, jealousy.  The green-eyed monster is not a frightening creature from outer space.  It is an expression used about four hundred years ago by British writer William Shakespeare in his play ""Othello.""
It describes the unpleasant feeling a person has when someone has something he wants.  A young man may suffer from the green-eyed monster if his girlfriend begins going out with someone else.  Or, that green-eyed monster may affect your friend if you get a pay raise and she does not.
In most places in the world, a green light is a sign to  move ahead.  A green light on a traffic signal means your car can  continue on.  In everyday speech, a green light means approval to continue with a project. We want you to know we have a green light to continue this series next week.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions That Come From Farming (VOA Special English 2008-06-09),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_06/audio/mp3/se-ws-farm.mp3, Farm: It's Not Worth a Hill of BeansTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.In the early days of human history, people survived by hunting wild animals, or gathering wild grains and plants for food.  Then, some people learned to grow crops and raise animals for food. They were the first farmers.
Since the sixteenth century, the word farm has meant agricultural land. But a much older meaning of the word farm is linked to economics. The word farm comes from the Latin word, firma, which means an unchanging payment.
Experts say the earliest meaning of the English word farm was a yearly payment made as a tax or rent.
Farmers in early England did not own their land. They paid every year to use agricultural lands.
In England, farmers used hawthorn trees along the edges of property. They called this row of hawthorns a hedge.
Hedging fields was how careful farmers marked and protected them.
Soon, people began to use the word hedging to describe steps that could be taken to protect against financial loss.
Hedging is common among gamblers who make large bets.  A gambler bets a lot of money on one team.  But, to be on the safe side, he also places a smaller bet on the other team, to reduce a possible loss.
You might say that someone is hedging his bet when he invests in several different kinds of businesses.  One business may fail, but likely not all.
Farmers know that it is necessary to make hay while the sun shines.
Hay has to be cut and gathered when it is dry.  So a wise farmer never postpones gathering his hay when the sun is shining.  Rain may soon appear.
A wise person copies the farmer.  He works when conditions are right.
A new mother, for example, quickly learns to try to sleep when her baby is quiet, even in the middle of the day.  If the mother delays, she may lose her chance to sleep.  So, the mother learns to make hay while the sun shines.
Beans are a popular farm crop.  But beans are used to describe something of very little value in the expression, not worth a hill of beans.  The expression is often used today.
You could say, for example, that a bad idea is not worth a hill of beans.
Language expert Charles Earle Funk said the expression was first used almost seven hundred years ago. He said Robert of Gloucester described a message from the King of Germany to King John of England as altogether not worth a bean.

Words and Their Stories: Military Expressions (VOA Special English 2008-08-20),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_08/audio/mp3/se-ws-doughboy.mp3, Doughboy: Military ExpressionsTEXT,"This is Phil Murray with WORDS AND THEIR STORIES, a program in Special English on the Voice of America.  We tell about some common expressions in American English.A leatherneck or a grunt do not sound like nice names to call someone. Yet men and women who serve in the United States armed forces are proud of those names.  And if you think they sound strange, consider doughboy and GI Joe.
After the American Civil War in the eighteen sixties, a writer in a publication called Beadle's Monthly used the word doughboy to describe Civil War soldiers. But word expert Charles Funk says that early writer could not explain where the name started.
About twenty years later, someone did explain. She was the wife of the famous American general George Custer.
Elizabeth Custer wrote that a doughboy was a sweet food served to Navy men on ships. She also said the name was given to the large buttons on the clothes of soldiers. Elizabeth Custer believed the name changed over time to mean the soldiers themselves.
Now, we probably most often think of doughboys as the soldiers who fought for the Allies in World War One.
By World War Two, soldiers were called other names. The one most often heard was GI, or GI Joe.  Most people say the letters GI were a short way to say general issue or government issue. The name came to mean several things. It could mean the soldier himself. It could mean things given to soldiers when they joined the military such as weapons, equipment or clothes. And, for some reason, it could mean to organize, or clean.
Soldiers often say, ""We GI'd the place."" And when an area looks good, soldiers may say the area is ""GI."" Strangely, though, GI can also mean poor work, a job badly  done.
Some students of military words have another explanation of GI. They say that instead of government issue or general issue, GI came from the words galvanized iron. The American soldier was said to be like galvanized iron, a material produced for special strength. The Dictionary of Soldier Talk says GI was used for the words galvanized iron in a publication about the vehicles of the early twentieth century.
Today, a doughboy or GI may be called a grunt. Nobody is sure of the exact beginning of the word.  But, the best idea probably is that the name comes from the sound that troops make when ordered to march long distances carrying heavy equipment.
A member of the United States Marines also has a strange name --  leatherneck.  It is thought to have started in the eighteen hundreds. Some say the name comes from the thick collars of leather early Marines wore around their necks to protect them from cuts during battles. Others say the sun burned the Marines' necks until their skin looked like leather.

Words and Their Stories: Sailors Are Responsible for Many Expressions (VOA Special English 2009-05-22),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_05/audio/mp3/se-ws-deep-six-23-may-09_0.mp3, Deep-Six: Fishing for Sailors' ExpressionsTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Sailors seem -- to those of us on land -- to lead exciting, even mysterious lives. Many things are different at sea. Even the language is different.
Simple words like ""right"" and ""left"" are not the same.  On a ship, ""right"" is ""starboard."" And ""left"" is ""port.""
Sailors also are responsible for many colorful English expressions.
One of these is deep-six. It means to hide something or put it where it will not be found. You can also deep-six,or reject a proposal.
One language expert says that deep six is the bottom of the ocean. ""Deep,"" in this case, means deepest. The ""six"" in the expression comes from the six feet that make up a fathom -- which is a little less than two meters.
Sailors measure the depth of the water in fathoms. Thus, the deep six is the deepest fathom...the final six feet at the bottom of the ocean. A sailor who never wants to see something again will give it the deep-six.  He will drop it from the ship to the ocean bottom.
You can deep-six something even if you are not a sailor. All you do is throw it away or put it where it will never be found. You might, for example, deep-six an unpleasant letter from a former friend.
Another expression linked to sailing  is batten down the hatches. That is what sailors do to prepare their ship for a storm at sea.
Battens are thin pieces of wood. Hatches are the openings in the deck. Before a storm, sailors cover the hatches with waterproof material. Then they nail on battens to hold the hatch coverings firmly in place. This keeps rain and waves out of the ship.
Now, people use the expression to mean to prepare for dealing with any kind of trouble.
A news report, for example, might say that people in Washington were battening down the hatches for a big winter storm. Or a newspaper might report that ""defense lawyers were 'battening down the hatches' for testimony by someone who observed the crime.""
An old expression of the sailors that is still heard is to sail under false colors.  Experts on language say the expression was born more than two hundred fifty years ago, when pirates sailed the seas, attacking and robbing trade ships.
Pirate ships often flew the flag of a friendly country as they sailed toward the ship they planned to rob. They sailed under false colors until they were close enough to attack. Then the pirates pulled down the false flag, and showed their true colors. They raised the pirate flag -- with its picture of a skull and crossed bones.
Today, a person, not a ship, is said to sail under false colors.  Such a person appears to be something he is not. His purpose is to get something from you. If you are careful, you will soon see his true colors, and have nothing to do with him.

Words and Their Stories: What American Workers Call Their Employers (VOA Special English 2007-09-05),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2007_09/audio/mp3/se-ws-top-brass.mp3, Top Brass: What American Workers Call Their EmployersTEXT,"I'm Susan Clark with the Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.The Italians have an old saying, ""Il dolce far niente.""  The words mean it is sweet, or enjoyable, to do nothing.On weekends and during holidays, many of us enjoy doing nothing. But most of the time we have to work. And, to keep our jobs, we must work hard. Our employer will not like it if we do nothing.American workers often call their employers bosses. The word boss comes from the Dutch word, baas, meaning master.Sometimes company bosses are called the brass. They also are sometimes called top brass, or brass hats.Experts disagree about how these strange expressions started. But, they may have come from Britain. Leaders of the nineteenth century British army wore pieces of metal called oak leaves on their hats. The metal, brass, has a color similar to that of gold. So a leader or commander came to be called a member of the brass.  Or he might have been called a brass hat.  Or, even the top brass.By the nineteen forties, the expression had spread beyond military leaders. It also included civilian officials.A newspaper in the American city of Philadelphia used the term in nineteen forty-nine. It called the most important police officials, top brass.Other expressions that mean boss or employer have nothing to do with brass or hats. One of these is big cheese.  A cheese is a solid food made from milk.The expression probably started in America in the late nineteenth century. Some experts believe it comes from a word in the Uersian or Urdu languages -- chiz. The meaning is a thing.  So the meaning of big cheese may be a big thing.Other experts say the word cheese in this expression was really an incorrect way of saying chief. The word chief means leader. So the expression may mean big leader.An employer usually does not object to being called boss. But most workers would not call their employers big cheeses, top brass or brass hats to their faces.These words are not really insulting. But neither do they show great respect.Employers also have expressions to describe their workers. One of them that describes a good worker is that he or she works like a Trojan. This expression probably comes from the ancient writings of the Greek poet Homer. He wrote about the Trojans who lived in the city of Troy. He said Trojans worked very hard to protect their city.Now, the expression often is used to describe an employee who works hard for a company. A loyal, hard-working employee is said to work like a Trojan.So be happy if your company's brass hats say you work like a Trojan.

They may consider you valuable enough to increase your pay.This Special English program, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES, was written by Jeri Watson. I'm Susan Clark.

"Word and Their Stories: Money"" Expressions - 1 (VOA Special English 2009-10-01)",http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_10/audio/mp3/se-ws-money part 10-03-oct-09_0.mp3," Money, Part 1TEXT","Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.I think people everywhere dream about having lots of money. I know I do. I would give anything to make money hand over fist. I would like to earn large amounts of money. You could win a large amount of money in the United States through lotteries. People pay money for tickets with numbers. If your combination of numbers is chosen, you win a huge amount of money – often in the millions. Winning the lottery is a windfall.
A few years ago, my friend Al won the lottery. It changed his life. He did not have a rich family. He was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth.  Instead, my friend was always hard up for cash. He did not have much money. And the money he did earn was chicken feed – very little.
Sometimes Al even had to accept hand-outs, gifts from his family and friends.  But do not get me wrong. My friend was not a deadbeat. He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply pinched pennies. He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact, he was often a cheapskate.  He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was flat broke and had no money at all.
One day, Al scraped together a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never strike it rich or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He hit the jackpot.  He won a great deal of money.
Al was so excited. The first thing he did was buy a costly new car. He splurged on the one thingthat he normally would not buy. Then he started spending money on unnecessary things. He started to waste it. It was like he had money to burn.  He had more money than he needed and it was burning a hole in his pocket so he spent it quickly.
When we got together for a meal at a restaurant, Al paid every time. He would always foot the bill, and pick up the tab. He told me the money made him feel like a million dollars. He was very happy.
But, Al spent too much money. Soon my friend was down and out again. He had no money left. He was back to being strapped for cash. He had spent his bottom dollar, his very last amount. He did not even build up a nest egg. He had not saved any of the money.
I admit I do feel sorry for my friend. He had enough money to live like a king. Instead, he is back to living on a shoestring -- a very low budget. Some might say he is penny wise and pound foolish. He was wise about small things, but not about important things.

"Words and Their Stories: ""Money"" Expressions - 2 (VOA Special English 2009-10-15)",http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_10/audio/mp3/se-ws-money part 3-18-oct-09_0.mp3, More Terms About MoneyTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Most people enjoy working for several reasons. Their job might be fun, or they like their employer and the other people at work. Most people I know, however, work for the money. I do not know anyone who is loaded, or extremely rich.  Most of my friends work to earn enough money to live. They have to make ends meet. They have to earn enough money to pay for the things they need. Some even live from hand to mouth. They only have enough money for the most important things.
They struggle to earn enough money to bring home the bacon. It can be difficult to earn enough money for a family to survive. Sometimes, poor people even get caught short.  They do not have enough money to pay for what they need.
Or they have to spend or lay out more money than they want for something. When this happens, poor people have to tighten their belts and live on less money than usual. I hate when I have to live on less money. It takes me longer to get back on my feet, or return to good financial health.
However, other people are on the gravy train. They get paid more money than their job is worth. These people make a bundle.  They really rake in the cash. In fact, they make so much money that they can live high off the hog. They own the best of everything and live in great ease. Sometimes they pay an arm and a leg for something.
Because money is no object to wealthy people, they will pay high prices for whatever they want. Sometimes, they even pay through the nose.  They pay too much for things.
I am not rich. I did not make a killing in the stock market when my stocks increased in value. Yet, I am not poor either. When I go out with friends, I do not want to shell out or pay a lot of money. Often, my friends and I will chip in or pay jointly for a fun night out. When we go to restaurants the meal is Dutch treat.  Each person pays his or her own share.
Once, the owner of a restaurant gave us a dinner on the house. We did not have to pay for our meals. However, I admit that we had to grease someone's palm. We had to pay money to the employee who led us to our table. The money was for a special request. Yes, it was a buy off. The employee put us at the top of the list for a table instead of making us wait like everyone else. We had a great time that night and the meal did not set me back at all.  I did not have to pay anything.
Because of that experience, I will always remember that nice things still happen in a world that is driven by money. But, that is just my two cents worth. It is just my opinion.

"Words and Their Stories: ""Money"" Expressions - 3 (VOA Special English 2007-12-10)",http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2007_12/audio/mp3/se-ws-money-part-two.mp3, More Money: Money Can Make People Do Strange ThingsTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Many people believe that money makes the world go around.  Others believe that money buys happiness.  I do not agree with either idea. But I do admit that money can make people do strange things. Let me tell you about a person I once knew who liked to play card games for money.  He liked to gamble.
My friend Bob had a problem because he liked to gamble at all costs.  He would play at any time and at any price. To take part in a card game such as poker, my friend would have to ante up.  He would have to pay a small amount of money at the beginning of the game.
Bob always played with cold, hard cash --only coins and dollar bills. Sometimes my friend would clean up.  He would win a lot of money on one card game.  He liked to tell me that one day he would break the bank.  What a feeling it must be to win all of the money at a gambling table!
Other times my friend would simply break even.  He neither won nor lost money.  But sometimes Bob would lose his shirt.  He would lose all the money he had. He took a beating at the gambling table.  When this happened, my friend would have to go in the hole.  He would go into debt and owe people money.
Recently, Bob turned to crime after losing all his money.  In his job, he kept the books for a small business.  He supervised the records of money earned and spent by the company.  Although my friend was usually honest, he decided to cook the books.  He illegally changed the financial records of the company. This permitted him to make a fast buck.  My friend made some quick, easy money dishonestly.
I never thought Bob would have sticky fingers.  He did not seem like a thief who would steal money.  But, some people will do anything for love of money.
Bob used the money he stole from his company to gamble again.  This time, he cashed in.  He made a lot of money.  Quickly he was back on his feet.  He had returned to good financial health.  His company, however, ended up in the red.  It lost more money than it earned.  The company was no longer profitable.
It did not take long before my friend's dishonesty was discovered.  The company investigated and charged him with stealing.  Bob tried to pass the buck. He tried to blame someone else for the deficit.  His lie did not work, however.  He ended up in jail.  Today, I would bet my bottom dollar that my friend will never gamble again.  I would bet all I have that he learned his lesson about gambling.

I made the deal with a friend, and we both made a profit.I had started a small company several years ago. I worked hard to make it successful. It was a sign-making business. It was a small company, not a blue chip company. It was not known nationally for the quality of its signs. It did not make millions of dollars in profits. And it was private. It was not a public company with shares traded on the stock market.Still, I worked hard building up my business. I did not work only a few hours each day -- no banker's hours for me. Instead I spent many hours each day, seven days a week, trying to grow the company. I never cut corners or tried to save on expenses. I made many cold calls. I called on possible buyers from a list of people I had never seen. Such calls were often hard sells. I had to be very firm.Sometimes I sold my signs at a loss. I did not make money on my product. When this happened, there were cut backs. I had to use fewer supplies and reduce the number of workers. But after several years, the company broke even. Profits were equal to expenses.

He offered me a ball park estimate of the amount he would pay to buy my company. But I knew his uneducated guess was low. My company was worth much more. He asked his bean-counter to crunch the numbers. That is, he asked his accountant to take a close look at the finances of my company and decide how much it was worth. Then my friend increased his offer.My friend's official offer was finally given to me in black and white. It was written on paper and more than I ever dreamed. I was finally able to get a break. I made a huge profit on my company, and my friend also got a bang for the buck.

Words and Their Stories: Stock Market Expressions (VOA Special English 2008-04-21),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_04/audio/mp3/se-ws-stock-market.mp3, Stock Market: The Business of InvestingTEXT,"I'm Phil Murray with WORDS AND THEIR STORIES, a program in Special English on the Voice of America.Today we tell about some American expressions that are commonly used in business.
Bells sound. Lighted messages appear. Men and women work at computers. They talk on the telephone. At times they shout and run around.This noisy place is a stock exchange. Here expert salespeople called brokers buy and sell shares of companies. The shares are known as stocks. People who own stock in a company, own part of that company.People pay brokers to buy and sell stocks for them. If a company earns money, its stock increases in value. If the company does not earn money,  the stock decreases in value.Brokers and investors carefully watch for any changes on the Big Board. That is the name given to a list of stocks sold on the New York Stock Exchange.The first written use of the word with that meaning was in a newspaper in Illinois in eighteen thirty-seven. It said: ""The sales on the board were one thousand seven hundred dollars in American gold.""Investors and brokers watch the Big Board to see if the stock market is a bull market or a bear market. In a bear market, prices go down. In a bull market, prices go up.Investors in a bear market promise to sell a stock in the future at a set price. But the investor does not own the stock yet. He or she waits to buy it when the price drops.The meaning of a bear market is thought to come from an old story about a man who sold the skin of a bear before he caught the bear. An English dictionary of the sixteen hundreds said, ""To sell a bear is to sell what one has not.""Word experts dispute the beginnings of the word bull in the stock market. But some say it came from the long connection of the two animals -- bulls and bears -- in sports that were popular years ago in England.Investors are always concerned about the possibility of a company failing. In the modern world, a company that does not earn enough profit is said to go belly up. A company that goes belly up dies like a fish. Fish turn over on their backs when they die. So they are stomach, or belly, up.Stock market investors do not want that to happen to a company. They want a company whose stock they own to earn more profit than expected. This would sharply increase the value of the stock. Investors are hoping for a windfall.The word windfall comes from England of centuries ago. There, poor people were banned from cutting trees in forests owned by rich land owners. But, if the wind blew down a tree, a poor person could take the wood for fuel. So a windfall is something wonderful that happens unexpectedly.This Special English program, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES, was written by Jeri Watson. This is Phil Murray.

Words and Their Stories: Financial Words and Expressions Used in Business and the Stock Market (VOA Special English 2009-04-25),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2009_04/audio/mp3/se-ws-in-the-red-26-apr-09_0.mp3, In the Red: When a Business is Losing MoneyTEXT,"Now, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES, a VOA Special English program about American expressions.I'm Rich Kleinfeldt  with some financial words and expressions used in business and the stock market.
Our first expression is ""in the red.""  It is another way of saying that a business is losing money.  In the past, numbers in the financial records of a company were written in red ink to show a loss.
A business magazine recently published a report about a television company.  The report said the company was still in the red, but was able to cut its loss from the year before.
A profit by a business is written in black numbers.  So a company that is ""in the black"" is making money.  An international news service reported that a private health insurer in Australia announced it was ""back in the black with its first profit in three years.""
Another financial expression is ""run on the bank.""  That is what happens when many people try to withdraw all their money from a bank.  A ""run on the bank"" usually happens when people believe there is danger a bank may fail or close.
Newspaper reports about a banking crisis in Russia used that expression.  They said the government acted because of fears that the crisis would cause a run on the banks.  ""When a run on the banks was starting, there was not much they could do,"" said a banking expert.
""Day trading"" is a system that lets investors trade directly on an electronic market system.  The system is known as NASDAQ, short for The National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation.  It was the first completely computerized stock market.  It sells stocks of companies not listed on any stock exchange.  Many high technology companies are listed on it.
Day trading companies provide a desk and a computer system to an investor who wants to trade.  Individuals must provide fifty thousand dollars or more to the trading company to pay for the stocks they buy.  Thousands of other investors do day trading from computers in their homes.
A day trader watches stock prices carefully.  When he sees a stock rise in price, he uses the computer to buy shares of the stock.  If the stock continues to rise in price in the next few minutes, the day trader sells the shares quickly to make a small profit.  Then he looks for another stock to buy.  If a stock goes down instead of up, he sells it and accepts the loss.
The idea is to make a small profit many times during the day.  Day traders may buy and sell stocks hundreds of times each day.
Many day traders lose all their money in a week or so.  Only about thirty percent succeed in earning enough from their efforts to continue day trading.

Words and Their Stories: Money Talks It's a Jungle Out There ... (VOA Special English 2008-02-11),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_02/audio/mp3/se-ws-money-talks.mp3, Money Talks: Everything Else WalksTEXT,"I'm Susan Clark with WORDS AND THEIR STORIES, a program in Special English on the Voice of America.People often say that money talks. They mean that a person with a lot of money can say how he or she wants things done. But it is not easy to earn enough money to gain this kind of power.Ask anyone in a business. They will tell you that it is a jungle out there. The expression probably began because the jungle is filled with wild animals and unknown dangers that threaten people. Sometimes people in business feel competing businesses are as dangerous as wild animals. And they feel that unknown dangers in the business world threaten the survival of their business.People in business have to be careful if they are to survive the jungle out there. They must not be led into making bogus investments. Bogus means something that is not real.Nobody is sure how the word got started. But it began to appear in American newspapers in the eighteen hundreds. A newspaper in Boston, Massachusetts, said the word came from a criminal whose name was Borghese. The newspaper said Borghese wrote checks to people although he did not have enough money in the bank. After he wrote the checks, he would flee from town. So, people who were paid with his checks received nothing. The newspaper said Americans shortened and changed the criminal's name Borghese, to bogus.People trying to earn money also must be aware of being ripped off. A person who is ripped off has had something stolen, or at least has been treated very unfairly.A writer for the magazine ""American Speech"" said he first saw the expression used in nineteen seventy-one. It was on a sign that a student carried during a protest demonstration at a university. The message on the sign was that the student felt ripped off, or cheated.Perhaps the best way to prevent getting ripped off in business is to not try to get rich quickly. To be successful, a person in business works hard and tries to get down to brass tacks.This expression means to get to the bottom or most important part of something. For example, a salesman may talk and talk about his product without saying the price. You get down to brass tacks when you say, ""it sounds good, but how much does it cost.""Word expert Charles Funk thinks the expression comes from sailors on ships. They clean the bottom of a boat. When they have removed all the dirt, they are down to the brass tacks, the copper pieces that hold the boat together.So, if we get down to brass tacks, we can prevent ripoffs and bogus ways of earning money in that jungle out there. And, some good luck will help, too.This  WORDS AND THEIR STORIES  was written by Jeri Watson. I'm Susan Clark.People often say that money talks.

Words and Their Stories: Talking About Economic Troubles (VOA Special English 2007-02-04),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2007_02/audio/mp3/se-ws-feel-the-oinch.mp3, Feel The Pinch: The Pains of Economic TroubleTEXT,"I'm Susan Clark with the Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.In the nineteen thirties, a song, ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?,"" was very popular in the United States. It was the time of the big Depression. The song had meaning for many people who had lost their jobs.
A dime is a piece of money whose value is one-tenth of a dollar. Today, a dime does not buy much. But it was different in the nineteen thirties. A dime sometimes meant the difference between eating and starving.
The American economy today is much better. Yet, many workers are concerned about losing their jobs as companies re-organize.
Americans have special ways of talking about economic troubles. People in businesses may say they feel the pinch.  Or they may say they are up against it.  Or, if things are really bad, they may say they have to throw in the towel.
A pinch is painful pressure. To feel the pinch is to suffer painful pressure involving money.
The expression, feel the pinch, has been used since the sixteenth century. The famous English writer William Shakespeare wrote something very close to this in his great play ""King Lear.""
King Lear says he would accept necessity's sharp pinch. He means he would have to do without many of the things he always had.
Much later, the Times of London newspaper used the expression about bad economic times during the eighteen sixties. It said, ""so much money having been spent ... All classes felt the pinch.""
Worse than feeling the pinch is being up against it.  The saying means to be in a lot of trouble.
Word expert James Rogers says the word ""it"" in the saying can mean any and all difficulties. He says the saying became popular in the United States and Canada in the late nineteenth century. Writer George Ade used it in a book called ""Artie."" He wrote, ""I saw I was up against it.""
Sometimes a business that is up against it will have to throw in the towel.  This means to accept defeat or surrender.
Throwing in the towel may mean that a company will have to declare bankruptcy. The company will have to take legal steps to let people know it has no money to pay its debts.
Word expert Charles Funk says an eighteen seventy-four publication called the Slang Dictionary explains throwing in the towel. It says the words probably come from the sport of boxing, or prizefighting. The book says the saying began because a competitor's face was cleaned with a cloth towel or other material. When a boxer's towel was thrown, it meant he was admitting defeat.
Most businesses do not throw in the towel. They just re-organize so they can compete better.

Words and Their Stories: Get Your Act Together & Cut to the Chase (VOA Special English 2007-12-31),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2007_12/audio/mp3/se-ws-act-together.mp3, Get Your Act Together: Organization Is the Name of the GameTEXT,"I'm Susan Clark with the Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.A woman from Japan was telling a friend about her trip to the United States. The woman had visited major businesses and investment companies in New York City and Chicago.
""I studied English before I left home, "" she said. ""But I still was not sure that people were speaking English.""
Her problem is easy to understand. Americans in business are like people who are in business anywhere. They have a language of their own. Some of the words and expressions deal with the special areas of their work. Other expressions are borrowed from different kinds of work such as the theater and movie industry.
One such saying is get your act together.
When things go wrong in a business, an employer may get angry. He may shout, ""Stop making mistakes. Get your act together.""
Or, if the employer is calmer, he may say, ""Let us get our act together.""
Either way, the meaning is the same. Getting your act together is getting organized. In business, it usually means to develop a calm and orderly plan of action.
It is difficult to tell exactly where the saying began. But, it is probable that it was in the theater or movie industry. Perhaps one of the actors was nervous and made a lot of mistakes. The director may have said, ""Calm down, now. Get your act together.""
Word expert James Rogers says the expression was common by the late nineteen seventies. Mr. Rogers says the Manchester Guardian newspaper used it in nineteen seventy-eight. The newspaper said a reform policy required that the British government get its act together.
Now, this expression is heard often when officials of a company meet. One company even called its yearly report, ""Getting Our Act Together.""
The Japanese visitor was confused by another expression used by American business people. It is cut to the chase.
She heard that expression when she attended an important meeting of one company. One official was giving a very long report. It was not very interesting. In fact, some people at the meeting were falling asleep.
Finally, the president of the company said, ""Cut to the chase.""
Cut to the chase means to stop spending so much time on details or unimportant material. Hurry and get to the good part.
Naturally, this saying was started by people who make movies. Hollywood movie producers believe that most Americans want to see action movies. Many of their movies show scenes in which the actors chase each other in cars, or in airplanes or on foot.
Cut is the director's word for stop. The director means to stop filming, leave out some material, and get to the chase scene now.
So, if your employer tells you to cut to the chase, be sure to get to the main point of your story quickly.

Words and Their Stories: Battle-Axe &; Bear the Brunt (VOA Special English 2006-11-07),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2006_11/audio/mp3/se-ws-battle-axe.mp3, Battle-Axe: Use at Your Own RiskTEXT,"I'm Susan Clark  with the Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Jane Smith is president of a large sales company in a city on the American West Coast. For years her company has made large profits. It has done well, even during bad economic times.
Miss Smith pays her workers well. She gives them many holidays. And last year, she increased the company's payments for employees who could not work because of sickness.
You probably think that Miss Smith's employees like her very much. But some do not. Some of her workers say she is a battle axe. They consider her a pushy, demanding woman.
A battle is an armed fight. And an axe is a tool for cutting trees. Word expert Christine Ammer says the two words were joined in the early nineteen hundreds. During those days, people began to call a fierce-acting woman a battle-axe. Soon the saying became popular.
In recent years, many women have protested the use of the word battle-axe. They say it is sexist. A comment or action that insults someone of the opposite sex is considered sexist.
But some people say calling a woman a battle-axe may not be an insult. Almost two thousand years ago, the Goths used battle-axes. The axes were very strong and sharp. They could cut through the heavy metal armor that Romans wore to protect themselves. The battle-axe permitted the Goths to win battles against the Romans. The Romans, at the time, were feared fighters.
So a woman who is a battle-axe may be a strong, sharp competitor in business. Many people praise men for being that way.
Sometimes employees believe their company leaders receive too much of the company's earnings. The employees suspect both men and women bosses of wanting too much money. Yet the leaders also bear the brunt of concern for the business.
What does this saying mean?
Bear can mean to carry. And brunt means the major part. To bear the brunt is to carry the major part of the responsibility for something.
The leaders of a company are responsible for how well the company does. Employees may work hard during the day. But most of them leave their work behind when they leave the office. The employer often works late and takes work home.
The saying, bear the brunt, was used as long ago as the fifteenth century. At that time, armies almost always stood in lines to fight.  Naturally, those in the front lines took the major force of the battle. They bore the brunt of the fighting.
So, perhaps Miss Smith, our businesswoman in California, is doing a good job. She may be called a battle-axe. But she is bearing the brunt of the responsibility for keeping her company competitive.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions Using the Number One (VOA Special English 2008-06-01),http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_06/audio/mp3/se-ws-numbers-1.mp3," Numbers: I, for One, Use These Expressions OftenTEXT","Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.Today I will tell about expressions using numbers. Let us start with the number one.  Numbers can be tricky. On the one hand, they are simply numbers. On the other hand, they have meanings. I for one use these expressions a lot.
Many people consider themselves number one, the most important person. They are always looking out for number one and taking care of number one. It is as if they are the one and only person on Earth. Some people however, are not so self-centered. My brother is such a person. It is true – no joke. I am not trying to pull a fast one on you.
First, you have to understand that my brother is one in a million. He is such a nice person. All his friends like him. They consider him one of the boys. Recently, my brother had a bad day at the office. It was just one of those days. Nothing went right. So he stopped at a local bar -- a drinking place -- after leaving work. My brother planned to have a glass of beer with his friends -- a quick one –  before he went home. But a quick one turned into one or two, and soon those became one too many.
As my brother was leaving, he ordered a last drink -- one for the road. His friends became concerned. One by one, they asked him if he was able to drive home safely.
Now my brother is a wise and calm person. He is at one with himself. He recognizes when he has had too much alcohol to drink. So he accepted an offer for a ride home from a female friend.
At one time in the past, my brother had been in love with this woman. She is a great person -- kind, thoughtful and intelligent -- all good qualities rolled up into one. But sadly their relationship did not work. He always used to say ""One of these days, I am going to marry this girl."" But that never happened.
For one thing, she did not love him as much as he loved her. It was just one of those things. The situation was regrettable and my brother had to accept it. But even now, he considers her the one that got away.
However, they are still friends. And because my brother had been kind to her, she felt that one good turn deserves another. He was good to her and she wanted to help him in return. So she drove him home.
If my brother had driven home from the bar that night, his number would have been up. Something bad would have happened. Thankfully he made it home safely. And, he and the woman are back to square one. They are back to where they started – being friends.
