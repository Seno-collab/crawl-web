Words and Their Stories: Expressions with the Word 'Cold' (VOA Special English 2008-03-19),,http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_03/audio/mp3/se-ws-cold.mp3, Cold: She Felt the Cold Hard Reality of LifeTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.	Cold weather has a great effect on how our minds and our bodies work. Maybe that is why there are so many expressions that use the word cold.	For centuries, the body's blood has been linked closely with the emotions. People who show no human emotions or feelings, for example, are said to be cold-blooded.  Cold-blooded people act in cruel ways. They may do brutal things to others, and not by accident.	For example, a newspaper says the police are searching for a cold-blooded killer.  The killer murdered someone, not in self-defense, or because he was reacting to anger or fear.  He seemed to kill for no reason, and with no emotion, as if taking someone's life meant nothing.	Cold can affect other parts of the body.  The feet, for example.  Heavy socks can warm your feet, if your feet are really cold.  But there is an expression -- to get cold feet -- that has nothing to do with cold or your feet.	The expression means being afraid to do something you had decided to do. For example, you agree to be president of an organization.  But then you learn that all the other officers have resigned.  All the work of the organization will be your responsibility.  You are likely to get cold feet about being president when you understand the situation.	Cold can also affect your shoulder.	You give someone the cold shoulder when you refuse to speak to them. You treat them in a distant, cold way.  The expression probably comes from the physical act of turning your back toward someone, instead of speaking to him face-to-face.  You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has not kept a promise he made to you.  Or, to someone who has lied about you to others.	A cold fish is not a fish.  It is a person.  But it is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional and shows no love or warmth.  A cold fish does not offer much of himself to anyone.	Someone who is a cold fish could be cold-hearted.  A cold-hearted person is someone who has no sympathy.  Several popular songs in recent years were about cold-hearted men or cold-hearted women who, without feeling, broke the hearts of their lovers.	Out in the cold is an expression often heard.  It means not getting something that everybody else got.  A person might say that everybody but him got a pay raise, that he was left out in the cold.  And it is not a pleasant place to be.

Words and Their Stories: Expressions with the Word 'Hot' (VOA Special English 2008-03-03),,http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2008_03/audio/mp3/se-ws-hot.mp3, Hot: He Was a Hotheaded Hot Shot!TEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.	Every language has its own special words and expressions.  And a story can be told about each of them.	Hot is a simple, easily-understood word.  So are most of the expressions made with the word hot.  But not always, as we shall see.	The words hot potato, for example, give you no  idea at all to the meaning of the expression, hot potato. The potato is a popular vegetable in the United States. Many people like baked potatoes, cooked in an oven or fire.  Imagine trying to carry a hot, baked potato in your hand.  It would be difficult, even painful, to do so.	Now we are getting close to the meaning of hot potato. Some publicly-disputed issues are highly emotional.  The issues must be  treated carefully, or  they  will be difficult and painful  if an elected official has to deal with them. As difficult and painful as holding a hot potato.	One such hot potato is taxes.	Calling  for higher taxes can mean defeat for a politician.  And yet, if taxes are not raised, some very popular government programs could be cut.  And that also can make a politician very unpopular.  So the questions must be dealt with carefully...the same way you would handle any other hot potato.	Another expression is not so hot.  If you ask someone how she feels, she may answer: ""not so hot.""   What she means is she does not feel well.	Not so hot also is a way of saying that you do not really like something.  You may tell a friend that the new play you saw last night is not so hot.  That means you did not consider it a success.	A hot shot is a person -- often a young person -- who thinks he can do anything.  At least he wants to try.  He is very  sure he can succeed.  But often he fails. The expression was born in the military forces.  A hot shot was a soldier who fired without aiming carefully. Hot is a word that is often used to talk about anger.	A person who becomes angry easily is called a hothead.  An angry person's neck often becomes red.  We say he is hot under the collar.  You could say that your friend is no hothead. But he got hot under the collar when someone took his radio.	In nineteen sixty-three, hot line appeared as a new expression.	The hot line was a direct communications link between the leaders of the  Soviet Union and the United States. The hot line had an important purpose: to prevent accidental war between the two competitors during the period known as the Cold War.  The American president and the Soviet leader were able  to  communicate directly and immediately on the hot line.  This helped  prevent  any conflict during an international crisis.

Words and Their Stories: Monkey Expressions (VOA Special English 2007-11-05),,http://www.voanews.com/MediaAssets2/learningenglish/2007_11/audio/mp3/se-ws-monkey.mp3, Monkey: No Monkey Business HereTEXT,"Now, the VOA Special English program WORDS AND THEIR STORIES.	Monkeys are very similar to us in many ways. Most have ten fingers and ten toes, and brains much like ours. We enjoy watching them because they often act like us. In fact, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution says that monkeys and humans share a common ancestor.	Songwriter William Gilbert, in the musical ""Princess Ida"", wrote:""Darwinian man, though well-behaved, at best is only a monkey shaved.""His words -- sung to Sir Arthur Sullivan's music -- make listeners smile. Well, monkeys make us smile, too, because they are creatures full of playful tricks.	This is why many monkey expressions are about tricky people or playful acts. One of these expressions is monkeyshines, meaning tricks or foolish acts.	The meaning is clear if you have ever watched a group of monkeys playfully chasing each other: pulling tails, stealing food, doing tricks. So, when a teacher says to a group of students: ""Stop those monkeyshines right now!"" you know that the boys and girls are playing, instead of studying.	You might hear that same teacher warn a student not to monkey around with a valuable piece of equipment. You monkey around with something when you do not know what you are doing. You are touching or playing with something you should leave alone.	Also, you can monkey around when you feel like doing something, but have no firm idea of what to do. For example, you tell your friend you are going to spend the day monkeying around with your car. You do not have any job or goal in mind. It is just a way to pass the time.	Monkey business usually means secret, maybe illegal, activities. A news report may say there is monkey business involved in building the new airport, with some officials getting secret payments from builders.	You may make a monkey out of someone when you make that person look foolish. Some people make a monkey out of themselves by acting foolish or silly.	If one monkey has fun, imagine how much fun a barrel of monkeys can have. If your friend says he had more fun than a barrel of monkeys at your party, you know that he had a really good time.	Monkey suits are common names for clothes or uniforms soldiers wear.	In earlier years in many American cities, you would find men playing musical hand organs on the street.  Dancing to the music would be the man's small monkey dressed in a tight-fitting, colorful jacket similar to a military uniform. So, people began to call a military uniform a monkey suit. This VOA Special English program, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES,  was written by Marilyn Rice Christiano.  Maurice Joyce was the narrator.  I'm Shirley Griffith.",5,

The hand has been a symbol through the ages and in many cultures.	There are hundreds of expressions and combinations of words using hand in the English language.  Let us examine some of the expressions that use hand. We will get a hand in this way. To get a hand in is to begin a job, to begin to know something about it.  When we learn the job completely, it will be easy for us.  We will be able to do it hands down.	If we do the job well, we may end up with the upper hand.  And that means to be in control, or to have gained complete understanding of a situation.	On the other hand, if the situation gets out of hand, then it is out of control.  We must act quickly to regain the upper hand over these expressions.	But, wait. We still do not have the upper hand in this business.	We must consider another way of expressing praise, to hand it to someone.  For example: I must hand it to you for understanding what we have discussed this far.	You can also lend a hand to someone, but without really giving up your hand.  You lend a hand when you help someone. You offer them a helping hand. If someone is kind enough to lend us a hand, then we surely do not want to bite the hand that feeds us.  We do not want to repay his kindness by treating him badly.	Now, with that out of the way, we have a free hand to continue examining other hand expressions. To have a free hand in a situation is good.  It means you are free to act without getting permission from someone else.	If we continue moving along, we will make progress hand over fist, or very rapidly. This expression began in the early seventeen hundreds.  It reportedly comes from a sailing expression hand over hand, the way of quickly raising or lowering a sail.	Maybe you can find a friend who wants to take a hand in our project.  It would have to be someone who is interested in these expressions.	Your friend may want to work hand in glove with us. That is good, because that means he wants to work as closely with us as a glove covers the hand.  Of course there is a danger that he may look at our project and decide to take it in hand.  That means he wants to take it over.	If that happens, we may throw up our hands because the situation seems hopeless. In fact, we may decide that it is time for us to end this project, to wash our hands of hand expressions.

A person's nose is important for breathing and smelling. The nose is also used in many popular expressions.	Some people are able to lead other people by the nose. For example, if a wife leads her husband by the nose, she makes him do whatever she wants him to do.	Some people are said to be hard-nosed.  They will not change their opinions or positions on anything. If someone is hard-nosed, chances are he will never pay through the nose, or pay too much money, for an object or service.	It is always helpful when people keep their nose out of other people's business. They do not interfere. The opposite of this is someone who noses around all the time.  This kind of person is interested in other people's private matters. He is considered nosey.	Someone who keeps his nose to the grindstone works very hard. This can help a worker keep his nose clean or stay out of trouble.	One unusual expression is that is no skin off my nose. This means that a situation does not affect or concern me. We also say that sometimes a person cuts off his nose to spite his face.  That is, he makes a situation worse for himself by doing something foolish because he is angry.	More problems can develop if a person looks down his nose at someone or something. The person acts like something is unimportant or worthless. This person might also turn up his nose at something that he considers not good enough. This person thinks he is better than everyone else. He has his nose in the air.	In school, some students thumb their nose at their teacher.  They refuse to obey orders or do any work.  Maybe these students do not know the correct answers.  My mother always told me, if you study hard, the answers should be right under your nose or easily seen.	I think we have explained the nose expressions. What about ears? Well, I hope you are all ears or very interested in hearing more expressions. We might even put a bug in your ear or give you an idea about something. We also advise you to keep your ear to the ground.  This means to be interested in what is happening around you and what people are thinking.	If you are a good person, you will lend an ear to your friends. You will listen to them when they have a problem they need to talk about. Our last expression is to play it by ear. This has two meanings. One is to play a song on a musical instrument by remembering the tune and not by reading the music. Play it by ear also means to decide what to do at the last minute instead of making detailed plans.	This VOA Special English program, WORDS AND THEIR STORIES, was written by Jill Moss.

There are many special terms in the world of business.	The following story is about a sweetheart deal which I made last week. I made the deal with a friend, and we both made a profit.	I had started a small company several years ago. I worked hard to make it successful. It was a sign-making business. It was a small company, not a blue chip company. It was not known nationally for the quality of its signs. It did not make millions of dollars in profits. And it was private. It was not a public company with shares traded on the stock market.	Still, I worked hard building up my business. I did not work only a few hours each day -- no banker's hours for me. Instead I spent many hours each day, seven days a week, trying to grow the company. I never cut corners or tried to save on expenses. I made many cold calls. I called on possible buyers from a list of people I had never seen. Such calls were often hard sells. I had to be very firm.	Sometimes I sold my signs at a loss. I did not make money on my product. When this happened, there were cut backs. I had to use fewer supplies and reduce the number of workers. But after several years, the company broke even. Profits were equal to expenses. And soon after, I began to gain ground. My signs were selling very quickly. They were selling like hotcakes.	I was happy. The company was moving forward and making real progress. It was in the black, not in the red. The company was making money, not losing it.	My friend knew about my business. He is a leader in the sign-making industry – a real big gun, if you know what I mean. He offered to buy my company. My friend wanted to take it public. He wanted to sell shares in the company to the general public.	My friend believed it was best to strike while the iron is hot. He wanted to take action at the best time possible and not wait. He offered me a ball park estimate of the amount he would pay to buy my company. But I knew his uneducated guess was low. My company was worth much more. He asked his bean-counter to crunch the numbers. That is, he asked his accountant to take a close look at the finances of my company and decide how much it was worth. Then my friend increased his offer.	My friend's official offer was finally given to me in black and white. It was written on paper and more than I ever dreamed. I was finally able to get a break. I made a huge profit on my company, and my friend also got a bang for the buck. He got a successful business for the money he spent.

Words and Their Stories: Money Talks It's a Jungle Out There ...

People often say that money talks. They mean that a person with a lot of money can say how he or she wants things done. But it is not easy to earn enough money to gain this kind of power.	Ask anyone in a business. They will tell you that it is a jungle out there. The expression probably began because the jungle is filled with wild animals and unknown dangers that threaten people. Sometimes people in business feel competing businesses are as dangerous as wild animals. And they feel that unknown dangers in the business world threaten the survival of their business.	People in business have to be careful if they are to survive the jungle out there. They must not be led into making bogus investments. Bogus means something that is not real.	Nobody is sure how the word got started. But it began to appear in American newspapers in the eighteen hundreds. A newspaper in Boston, Massachusetts, said the word came from a criminal whose name was Borghese. The newspaper said Borghese wrote checks to people although he did not have enough money in the bank. After he wrote the checks, he would flee from town. So, people who were paid with his checks received nothing. The newspaper said Americans shortened and changed the criminal's name Borghese, to bogus.	People trying to earn money also must be aware of being ripped off. A person who is ripped off has had something stolen, or at least has been treated very unfairly.	A writer for the magazine ""American Speech"" said he first saw the expression used in nineteen seventy-one. It was on a sign that a student carried during a protest demonstration at a university. The message on the sign was that the student felt ripped off, or cheated.	Perhaps the best way to prevent getting ripped off in business is to not try to get rich quickly. To be successful, a person in business works hard and tries to get down to brass tacks.	This expression means to get to the bottom or most important part of something. For example, a salesman may talk and talk about his product without saying the price. You get down to brass tacks when you say, ""it sounds good, but how much does it cost.""Word expert Charles Funk thinks the expression comes from sailors on ships. They clean the bottom of a boat. When they have removed all the dirt, they are down to the brass tacks, the copper pieces that hold the boat together.	So, if we get down to brass tacks, we can prevent ripoffs and bogus ways of earning money in that jungle out there. And, some good luck will help, too.
